# Etch-A-Sketch

An interactive web-based drawing application that allows users to create and customize a grid canvas and "sketch" on it by clicking on squares. Each square darkens incrementally with every click, enabling users to create unique, colorful patterns.

## Features

- **Customizable Grid:** Choose a grid size up to 100x100 squares.
- **Interactive Drawing:** Click on any square to gradually increase its opacity, creating a darkening effect.
- **Dynamic Colors:** Squares start with a random RGB color on the first click and progressively darken.
- **Reset Grid:** Clear the canvas and start with a new grid size at any time.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Grid:** The canvas starts with a default 16x16 grid.
2. **User Input:** Click the "Set Grid Size" button to input a new grid size (maximum: 100x100).
3. **Sketching:** Click on any square to darken it with a random color that increases its opacity with each click.
4. **Reset:** Change the grid size or clear the canvas to start over.
